# TechBot_
A discord bot designed to provide complete nonsense. 

It is mostly just a fun javascript playground for myself that intergrates into discrod.

# Features
   * Statistics:
      - Server logs
      - per user message count
      - Server-wide word count*
      - Message filtering
   * Avatar pull - get a users profile icon
   * Info - get user and server information

# How to setup
   Three files are needed in the root directory:
   1) key.txt - this file holds the discord bot's login key
   2) guild.txt - this file is the guild/s (aka Discord servers) that the bot connects to. You can add more than 1 by placing the next entry on a newline.
   3) client.txt - The discord bot's client id
      
   Next if you don't have nodejs get it: https://nodejs.org/en/
   
   run ```npm update``` in the root to get pacakges required.
   
   Then launch the bot with ```node index.js``` and hope everything works!
